Usage in battles
AP, nice, and nice-T rounds are effective against light pillboxes, 
light tanks, armoured trucks, SPGs, artillery, AAA.
Usually incapable of an instant kill or a "snapshot" kill unless you 
pilot snipe, but is quite capable of a "snapshot fire" (not guaranteed
 though)... which is almost a kill...
 Incredible range (can hit and still light a fire at 1.5km+, but damage
  does drop off). Good for long range desperation/harassment shots.
